## üß≠ High-Level Project Overview

### üßë‚Äçüíº Project Name
**Telegram Code of Conduct Agreement Bot**

### üéØ Goal
Ensure every group member ‚Äî existing and new ‚Äî explicitly agrees to the group's Code of Conduct (CoC) before being allowed to post messages in Telegram groups you administer. The bot is designed for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi with power-outage resilience.

### üß© Summary
A custom Telegram bot will:
1. **Onboard new members** by requiring them to agree to the CoC before they can post.
2. **Recover from power outages** by checking for unagreed members on startup.
3. **Provide tools for onboarding existing members** through a series of admin commands.
4. **Record and track agreement data** in a local SQLite database.
5. **Allow admins** to view reports and manage the agreement process.

### üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Libraries:** `python-telegram-bot`, `sqlite3`, `python-dotenv`
* **Database:** SQLite
* **Hosting:** Raspberry Pi (or any Linux server)

## üìã Functional Requirements

### 1. Onboarding Flow for New Members
* Detects when a new user joins the group.
* Immediately restricts the user from sending messages.
* Sends them a private message (or inline group message) with a link to the CoC and an "Agree" button.
* When the user clicks "Agree", the bot records their agreement and lifts the restrictions.

### 2. Onboarding Flow for Existing Members
*   **Automatic Gatekeeper**: The bot checks every message sent in the group. If a user who has not agreed to the CoC attempts to chat, their message is deleted, they are restricted, and they are sent a DM with instructions. This ensures all active members are onboarded.
*   **Manual Admin Commands**: For proactive management, admins can use `/restrict_existing` to restrict all known unagreed members at once, and `/sendcode_dm` or `/sendcode_group` to notify them.

### 3. Power Recovery & Missed Members
* On bot startup, it scans its database for all known users in all known groups.
* It identifies any member who has not agreed to the *current* CoC version (this handles users who joined during downtime or users who need to agree to a new version).
* It restricts them and sends a "Recovery Notice" with the agreement prompt.

### 4. Data Storage in SQLite
The database stores user agreements, including:
* User ID, username, and full name
* Group ID and name
* Timestamp of agreement
* CoC version agreed to

### 5. Admin Commands
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/whoagreed` | List users who have agreed to the current version. |
| `/restrict_existing` | Proactively restricts all known, unagreed members. |
| `/sendcode_group` | Sends a public CoC agreement message to the group. |
| `/sendcode_dm` | Sends a private DM to all known, unagreed members. |
| `/export` | View agreement statistics and recent agreements. |
| `/setversion` | Display instructions for updating the CoC version. |

### 6. Configuration
All configuration is handled via an `.env` file, including the bot token, admin user IDs, CoC link, and CoC version.
