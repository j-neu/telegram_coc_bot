# Telegram Code of Conduct Agreement Bot

A self-hosted Telegram bot (designed for Raspberry Pi) that ensures every group member explicitly agrees to the group's Code of Conduct before being allowed to post messages.

## Features

- **New Member Onboarding**: Automatically restricts new members until they agree to the CoC
- **Power Recovery**: Checks for unagreed members on startup (handles power outages/restarts)
- **Existing Member Prompts**: Allows admins to send CoC agreement requests to all members
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight local storage, perfect for Raspberry Pi
- **Admin Commands**: Comprehensive admin tools for monitoring and managing agreements
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: DM with group message fallback for user notifications
- **Version Control**: Track different CoC versions and require re-agreement when updated
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Test without restricting users

## Why Raspberry Pi?

- ‚úÖ One-time cost (~$45 for Pi 4)
- ‚úÖ Very low power consumption (~$5/year electricity)
- ‚úÖ Full control over your data
- ‚úÖ No monthly fees
- ‚úÖ Runs 24/7 reliably
- ‚úÖ Handles power outages gracefully

**Cost comparison:** Cloud hosting costs $60-84/year. A Raspberry Pi pays for itself in ~8 months!

## Prerequisites

### Hardware (Recommended)
- **Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB)** - $45 (or Pi 3, Pi Zero 2 W)
- MicroSD card (16GB+)
- Power supply
- Internet connection (WiFi or Ethernet)

### Software
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite (installed on SD card)
- Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- Your Telegram User ID (from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

## Quick Start (Raspberry Pi)

### 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS

1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Flash "Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)" to SD card
3. In settings (‚öôÔ∏è):
   - Enable SSH
   - Set username/password
   - Configure WiFi
   - Set timezone
4. Insert SD card and boot Pi

### 2. Connect and Setup

```bash
# SSH into your Pi
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip git

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telegram_coc_bot.git
cd telegram_coc_bot

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Bot

Create `.env` file:
```bash
nano .env
```

Add your configuration:
```
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
ADMIN_IDS=your_telegram_user_id
COC_VERSION=1.0
COC_LINK=https://your-code-of-conduct-url
STORAGE_TYPE=sqlite
DRY_RUN=false
```

Save with `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`

### 4. Test the Bot

```bash
# Test run
python3 bot.py

# You should see:
# Storage type: sqlite
# Database initialized successfully
# Bot starting...
# Running startup check for unagreed members...

# Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### 5. Auto-Start on Boot

Create systemd service:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/telegram-coc-bot.service
```

Paste this:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Telegram Code of Conduct Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/telegram_coc_bot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/telegram_coc_bot/bot.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable telegram-coc-bot
sudo systemctl start telegram-coc-bot
sudo systemctl status telegram-coc-bot
```

### 6. Add Bot to Telegram Group

1. Add bot to your Telegram group
2. Make it admin with these permissions:
   - ‚úÖ Delete messages
   - ‚úÖ Ban users
   - ‚úÖ **Restrict members (REQUIRED)**

Done! Your bot is now running 24/7.

## Power Recovery Feature

**What happens during power outage:**

1. Pi loses power, bot goes offline
2. Members join the group while bot is offline
3. Pi power returns, bot restarts automatically (systemd)
4. Bot runs startup check:
   - Scans all groups it's in
   - Finds members who haven't agreed
   - Restricts them and sends CoC message
   - Includes "Recovery Notice" in message

**Example recovery message:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Recovery Notice: The bot was offline when you joined.

Welcome! üëã

Before you can participate in this group, please review and agree to our Code of Conduct.
```

This ensures **no one slips through** even during downtime!

## Usage

### For New Members

1. New member joins the group
2. Bot automatically restricts them
3. They receive CoC message (DM or in-group)
4. After clicking "Agree", they can post messages

### Admin Commands

All admin commands work in the group:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Send CoC agreement prompt (anyone can use) |
| `/whoagreed` | List all users who have agreed to current CoC version |
| `/whohasnotagreed` | Check which members haven't agreed yet |
| `/sendcode` | Send CoC agreement request to all group members |
| `/setversion <version>` | Display instructions for updating CoC version |
| `/export` | View agreement statistics and recent agreements |

### Agreement Data

The bot stores in SQLite database (`coc_agreements.db`):
- User ID (Telegram)
- Username
- Full Name
- Group ID
- Group Name
- Agreement Timestamp (UTC)
- CoC Version

## Managing Your Bot

### View Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
sudo journalctl -u telegram-coc-bot -f

# Last 50 lines
sudo journalctl -u telegram-coc-bot -n 50
```

### Restart Bot
```bash
sudo systemctl restart telegram-coc-bot
```

### Stop Bot
```bash
sudo systemctl stop telegram-coc-bot
```

### Update Bot Code
```bash
cd ~/telegram_coc_bot
sudo systemctl stop telegram-coc-bot
git pull
sudo systemctl start telegram-coc-bot
```

### Backup Database
```bash
# Manual backup
cp ~/telegram_coc_bot/coc_agreements.db ~/coc_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Download to your computer
scp pi@raspberrypi.local:~/telegram_coc_bot/coc_agreements.db ./backup.db
```

## Testing Mode

To test without restricting users, set `DRY_RUN=true` in `.env`:

```bash
nano .env
# Change: DRY_RUN=true

sudo systemctl restart telegram-coc-bot
```

In dry-run mode:
- Bot logs what it would do
- No users are actually restricted
- Agreements are still recorded
- Perfect for testing in production groups

View logs to see `[DRY RUN]` messages.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not starting
```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u telegram-coc-bot -n 50

# Common issues:
# - Wrong BOT_TOKEN in .env
# - Missing dependencies
# - Database permission issues
```

### Can't restrict users
- Make sure bot is admin in Telegram group
- Verify "Restrict members" permission is enabled
- Check logs for permission errors

### Power recovery not working
- Check systemd service is enabled: `systemctl is-enabled telegram-coc-bot`
- Verify auto-start: `sudo systemctl enable telegram-coc-bot`
- Check logs after reboot: `sudo journalctl -u telegram-coc-bot -n 100`

### Database errors
```bash
# Check database exists
ls -l ~/telegram_coc_bot/coc_agreements.db

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 644 ~/telegram_coc_bot/coc_agreements.db
```

## Performance

This bot is very lightweight:
- **RAM:** ~50-100 MB
- **CPU:** <1% most of the time
- **Storage:** ~1KB per user agreement
- **Network:** Minimal bandwidth

Even a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W ($15)** can handle this!

## Security Notes

- Database stored locally on your Pi
- Never commit `.env` to version control (already in `.gitignore`)
- Change default Pi password: `passwd`
- Keep system updated: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- Consider installing `fail2ban` for SSH protection
- Rotate bot token periodically via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## Alternative Deployment Options

While this bot is optimized for Raspberry Pi, it also works on:

- **Other cloud platforms:** See `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` and `RENDER_DEPLOY.md`
- **Any Linux server:** Follow Raspberry Pi guide, adjust paths
- **VPS:** DigitalOcean, Linode, etc. (See `DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- **Windows/Mac:** Run `python bot.py` directly (not recommended for production)
